# Project 5: Student Management Dashboard

## Overview
This project is a simple and responsive web-based **Student Management Dashboard** built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. It allows users to manage student records by adding, editing, deleting, and searching entries. All data is stored in the browser’s `localStorage`.

## Features
- Add new student records with:
  - Name
  - Registration number
  - Department
  - Year
  - Marks
- Edit existing student details
- Delete student records
- Search students by name or registration number
- Data persistence using `localStorage`
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop

## Technologies Used
- **HTML** – for structuring the web page  
- **CSS** – for styling and layout  
- **JavaScript** – for interactivity and local data storage  

## How It Works
1. **Adding Students**: Fill in the form and click **“Add Student”** to add the entry to the list.  
2. **Editing Students**: Click the **“Edit”** button to load data into the form, make changes, and submit again.  
3. **Deleting Students**: Click the **“Delete”** button to remove a student record after confirmation.  
4. **Searching Students**: Use the search bar to filter student records by name or registration number.  
5. **LocalStorage**: All student data is saved in the browser, so it remains available even after refreshing the page.  

## How to Run
1. Download or clone the repository.  
2. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser.  
3. Interact with the dashboard directly—no server or backend needed.  

## Files
- `index.html` – Main HTML file  
- `style.css` – Stylesheet for layout and appearance  
- `script.js` – JavaScript logic for student management  

## Notes
- No external libraries or frameworks are used.  
- This project is ideal for learning basic web development, DOM manipulation, and working with local storage.
